# Working notes for this project

Read this before changing anything. It records decisions that are not recoverable from the code, and
one rule that must never be broken.

## The hard rule: never edit a flashcard answer

`physio_flashcards.html` holds 4,440 true/false statements. **These exact statements, with these
exact answers, appear in the computer test.** They are not a knowledge base to be corrected — they
are the answer key being examined on.

If standard physiology disagrees with a stored answer:

1. **Leave the answer alone.**
2. Add a `w` (warning) field to that card's explanation saying what the deck says, what physiology
   says, and *to answer as the deck says in the test*.
3. Tell the user, with the card index and the reasoning.

Two cards currently carry a warning, both in Endocrinology:

| Index | Statement | Deck says | Physiology says |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | "All hormone levels decrease in aging." | True | False — FSH/LH rise sharply after menopause, PTH usually rises |
| 32 | "Oxytocin acts via cAMP." | True | False — the oxytocin receptor is Gq → IP₃/Ca²⁺; cAMP is ADH at V2 |

Before committing any change to that file, verify nothing moved:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json,re,subprocess
orig=subprocess.run(["git","show","1a2be9b:physio_flashcards.html"],capture_output=True,text=True).stdout
o=orig.split('\n')[32]; O=json.loads(o[o.index('['):o.rindex(']')+1])
new=open('physio_flashcards.html',encoding='utf-8').read()
n=re.search(r'id="deck-data">(.*?)</script>',new,re.S).group(1).replace('<\\/script>','</script>')
N=json.loads(n)
qo=[(q['q'],q['a']) for t in O for q in t['questions']]
qn=[(q['q'],q['a']) for t in N for q in t['questions']]
print("identical:", qo==qn, "| count:", len(qn))
PY
```

`1a2be9b` is the original upload. It must print `identical: True | count: 4440`.

## What this project is

Two static files, no build step, no npm, no bundler. React 18 UMD + in-browser Babel from a CDN.
Netlify serves `main` at <https://peppy-lokum-2c5109.netlify.app>.

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | the study planner — 7 tabs: Today, Plan, Progress, Goals, Health, Timeline, Productivity |
| `physio_flashcards.html` | 4,440 true/false cards across 9 topics |
| `README.md` | user-facing feature documentation |

Deploy is: commit on `test` → `git checkout main && git merge test --ff-only` → `git push origin main`.
Netlify picks it up in well under a minute.

## Conventions that must be matched

- **Styling**: CSS custom properties in `:root` (warm paper `#FAF6EC`, ink `#2C2A26`, olive accent
  `#5E7155`, hairline `#E7E0CF`), a handful of utility classes, and inline `style={{}}` objects
  referencing `var(--…)`. Newsreader serif for headings. No Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS, no new fonts.
- **State**: plain `useState`, one data object, actions bundled in a single `A` object passed as one
  prop. No Context, no Redux.
- **Persistence**: one JSON blob in `localStorage`, saved on every change, plus a mirror in a hidden
  Google Drive `appDataFolder`. `migrate()` uses `Object.assign(DEFAULT_DATA(), d)`, so **adding a
  key to `DEFAULT_DATA()` seeds it for existing users automatically** — that is the seeding
  mechanism, don't invent another.
- **No new dependencies.** Everything so far is hand-rolled inline SVG and CSS. Ask before adding one.
- **Animation**: use CSS transitions, not `requestAnimationFrame`, so the blanket
  `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rule kills them for free. Stagger timers are the only
  thing that needs an explicit reduced-motion branch.

## Explanations: the pipeline and its actual error rate

Explanations live in a second JSON island, `<script type="application/json" id="<topic>-exp">`,
keyed by question index: `{"12": {"e": "...", "s": "Guyton & Hall 14e, Ch.75 — ...", "w": "optional warning"}}`.

**Generated explanations are wrong often enough that verification is not optional.** Measured:

| Run | Written | Needed correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General Physiology pilot (120) | 120 | 6 flagged (5%) |
| Endocrinology (454) | 454 | 44 corrected, 7 sources dropped (~10%) |

Errors were real: a sodium-channel selectivity figure out by an order of magnitude, osmolarity
numbers that didn't multiply out, a membrane potential contradicting the chapter it cited.

The working recipe, per topic:

1. Split the topic into batches of ~26 questions as JSON files.
2. One agent per batch writes explanations with a textbook-level citation and sets
   `answerLooksWrong` where the physiology disagrees with the key.
3. **Two independent checkers per batch with different lenses** — one on mechanism and numbers, one
   on "does this explanation actually support the stored answer, and is the citation plausible".
   Diversity catches more than redundancy.
4. A repair agent rewrites only what was flagged, with both critiques in hand. If it cannot stand
   behind a citation, it returns an empty source — **a blank source is better than a wrong one**.
5. Anything still disputing the stored answer goes to a separate adjudication: two examiners, one of
   them explicitly instructed to *defend* the deck. Only unanimous high-confidence disputes become
   warnings.

Batch files go in the scratchpad, not the repo.

**There is a reusable workflow for this.** It is generic over topic — pass
`{dir, topic, label, batches}` and it runs the whole write → double-verify → repair pipeline:

```text
~/.claude/projects/-Users-linas-Projects-study-planner/workflows/scripts/topic-explanations-*.js
```

Invoke it with `Workflow({scriptPath: "<that file>", args: {...}})`. Prepare the batch files first:

```python
# split one topic into batches of 26 under <scratchpad>/<topic>/bNN.json
import json, os, re
s = open('physio_flashcards.html', encoding='utf-8').read()
d = re.search(r'id="deck-data">(.*?)</script>', s, re.S).group(1).replace('<\\/script>', '</script>')
t = [x for x in json.loads(d) if x['id'] == TOPIC][0]
qs, B = t['questions'], 26
for b in range((len(qs) + B - 1) // B):
    chunk = [{"i": i, "q": qs[i]['q'], "a": qs[i]['a']} for i in range(b*B, min((b+1)*B, len(qs)))]
    json.dump({"topic": TOPIC, "batch": b, "questions": chunk}, open(f"{DIR}/{TOPIC}/b{b:02d}.json", "w"), indent=1)
```

Two topics can run at once — the agents are network-bound, not CPU-bound, and each workflow gets its
own concurrency cap. Beyond two, they start queueing behind each other for no gain.

### Coverage

| Topic | Cards | Explanations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endocrinology | 454 | ✅ done |
| Nervous System | 502 | in progress |
| Kidney | 680 | ✗ |
| Physiology of Blood | 602 | ✗ |
| Gastrointestinal Tract | 510 | ✗ |
| Circulation | 499 | ✗ |
| Special Senses | 466 | ✗ |
| Respiratory | 365 | ✗ |
| General Physiology | 362 | ✗ (120 piloted, not shipped) |

To wire a new topic in: add its island to the `EXPL` map at the top of the Babel script. The UI shows
an explanation where one exists and silently omits the panel where it doesn't.

### Answer audit

198 questions sampled across all 9 topics were audited for correctness — 3 flagged, all 3 defended,
**zero confirmed errors**. That is a 4.5% sample, not a clean bill of health for all 4,440.

## Two merges that work differently, on purpose

- **Planner** (`index.html`): whole-blob, newest `updatedAt` wins. Fine — it is one person's data
  edited in one place at a time.
- **Flashcards**: **per-card union, never subtraction.** The two devices held genuinely different
  progress (Endocrinology 91 known on the phone, 41 on the Mac). A newest-blob-wins merge would have
  destroyed one of them outright. Conflicts prefer the newer per-card timestamp; where neither side
  has one — all progress recorded before scheduling existed — **"review" wins**, because re-seeing a
  card you knew costs seconds and hiding one you didn't costs marks.

Do not "simplify" the flashcard merge into the planner's. It is different deliberately.

---

## Things already fixed — don't reintroduce them

- **Auto-advance.** Cards used to jump on 1.4s after a correct answer. Not enough time to read the
  answer, let alone the explanation. Removed. Advancing is manual: space, Next, or arrow keys.
- **The second tap.** Answering TRUE/FALSE now grades the card (right → Good, wrong → Again). The
  separate known / needs-review buttons are gone. Hard and Easy are optional, after the reveal.
- **Focus theft.** The planner's Google token refresh fired on a timer regardless of what the user
  was doing, and `requestAccessToken` opens a popup, which drags the browser to the front. Gate any
  token call on `document.hasFocus()` — `visibilityState` is *not* enough, a tab stays "visible"
  while another app covers it.
- **The 460 KB Babel compile.** The question bank lives in a JSON island, not inside the Babel
  script, so cold loads no longer recompile it. Keep it that way.
- **`exam_planer.html`** — a back-link to a file that never existed. The planner is `index.html`.

---

## Dates that go stale

- Computer test **2026-08-14**, oral **2026-08-24**, both in `EXAMS` in `index.html`.
- Flashcard scheduling caps intervals at the day before `EXAM_ISO` in `physio_flashcards.html` —
  this is cramming, not lifelong retention, so nothing is scheduled past the test.
- The Productivity tab derives its pacing from `EXAMS`, so it self-corrects when the exam moves.

---

## Open items

- Explanations for the remaining 7 topics (see the coverage table).
- The user has **not yet switched on flashcard sync** — until they tap "Turn on sync", phone and Mac
  still keep separate progress. That was the original complaint; the fix is built but dormant.
- The Health tracker has no CSV/Markdown export yet, so its data has no backup path.
- Only one of three redesign directions survived a truncated payload during the flashcard redesign;
  the other two were never scored.
